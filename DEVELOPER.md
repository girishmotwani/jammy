# Developer Documentation

Jammy uses armclient to perform cRUID operations on Azure resources. It uses python representation of the resources to
manipulate the resources. The python representations are generated using the swagger specification. Autorest tool can 
be used to auto-generate the resource models.

Jammy source code is organized into two top level folders:
* lib
* tests

The lib/ folder has the framework infrastructure to make testing easy.

It includes an Armclient wrapper to enable making REST API calls to Azure and 
perform CRUD operations on resources, create resource group,
deploy templates etc.

In addition, the models folder contains autogenerated code (using the swagger spec for the resource)
for the Azure resources you want to test.


The test folder contains the test cases for the resources to be tested. Since Jammy uses the pytest framework,
the tests need to conform to the requirements of pytest for identifying test classes/methods.
